# Memory Game
This is your standard 2 card memory game. The user must find card matches in the deck to win in the least amount of moves. The users star rating is determined on the amount of moves taken to over-turn and match all cards. If you don't remember this game from your childhood... it will be all the more fun and challenging to you.

##How to Play
Load the page, the timer and score panel will start upon your first card click. You will then click another card and hope for a match, continue on this path until you have matched all cards in the deck.
